JS4 coding assignment

Question  1 - when the code runs it will
- Show the difference between the first and last elements in the original ages array.
- Add a new age and show the new difference, demonstrating that the code works for arrays of different lengths.
- Calculate and log the average age of all the elements in the array.

Question 2 - when the code runs it will
- Calculate and log the average number of letters in the names provided in the array.
- Concatenate all the names together into a single string, separated by spaces, and log that string to the console.

Question 3 - When the code runs it will
- myArray.length gives you the total count of elements in the array.
- Since array indices are zero-based, myArray.length - 1 will give you the index of the last element.
- myArray[myArray.length - 1] is then used to access the last element of the array.

 Question 4 - 
- To access the first element of any array in JavaScript, you can simply use the index 0.

 Question 5 - 
- When you run this code, the nameLengths array will be filled with the lengths of each corresponding name from the names array. For your example, the nameLengths will be [3, 5, 3, 5, 4, 3].

 Question 6 - 
- When you run this code, it will calculate the sum of all elements in the nameLengths array, which is 23 for the provided array.

 Question 7 - 
- This function defines an empty string result and then loops n times, each time adding the word to result. Finally, it returns the concatenated string. The example usage will log 'HelloHelloHello' to the console.

Question 8 - 
- This function simply concatenates firstName, a space character, and lastName to create a full name and returns it. The example usage demonstrates how to call the function and log the returned full name to the console.

Question 9 - 
- This function iterates through each element of the input array, adds up the total, and then checks if the total is greater than 100. It returns true if the sum is greater than 100, otherwise false. The example usage demonstrates how to call the function and log the result to the console.

Question 10 - 
- This function sums all elements in the input array and divides the total by the number of elements to find the average. It checks if the array is empty to prevent division by zero. The example usage shows how to call the function and log the average to the console.

Question 11 -
- This code defines a calculateAverage helper function to find the average of numbers in an array. The isFirstAverageGreater function then uses this helper to compare the averages of two arrays, returning true if the average of the first array is greater than that of the second, and false otherwise. The example usage demonstrates how to call the function and log the result.

Question 12 - 
- This function checks if it is hot outside (isHotOutside is true) and if the moneyInPocket is greater than 10.50. If both conditions are met, it returns true, indicating that you will buy a drink; otherwise, it returns false.

Question 13 -
- This function uses a regular expression to check if the input email address matches a basic pattern for email addresses (something like name@domain.com). It's a simple and common way to do a preliminary check on user input in web forms, ensuring that the email provided follows a general structure before possibly sending it through more rigorous validation or saving it to a database.
